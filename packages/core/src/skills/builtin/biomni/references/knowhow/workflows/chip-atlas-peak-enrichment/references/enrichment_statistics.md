# Enrichment Statistics

Statistical methods used by the ChIP-Atlas Enrichment Analysis API.

## Fisher's Exact Test

The ChIP-Atlas API uses Fisher's exact test on a 2x2 contingency table to assess
whether input genes are significantly enriched for binding by each ChIP-seq
experiment compared to RefSeq background.

### Contingency Table

|                      | Overlapping peaks | No overlapping peaks |
| -------------------- | :---------------: | :------------------: |
| **Input genes**      |         a         |          b           |
| **All RefSeq genes** |         c         |          d           |

Where:

- **a**: Number of input genes with promoter peaks (reported as numerator of
  overlap_a)
- **b**: Input genes without peaks
- **c**: RefSeq genes with promoter peaks (from overlap_b)
- **d**: RefSeq genes without peaks
- Total RefSeq genes: ~18,622 (hg38)

### P-value

One-sided Fisher's exact test for enrichment (odds ratio > 1). API reports as
log10(p-value), e.g., -12.02 means p = 10^-12.02.

## Benjamini-Hochberg Q-values

Multiple testing correction applied across all experiments tested:

1. Rank all experiments by p-value
2. Calculate adjusted p-value: `q_i = p_i * N / rank_i`
3. Enforce monotonicity

API reports as log10(q-value). Use q < 0.05 for genome-wide significance.

## Fold Enrichment

```
fold_enrichment = (a / n_input) / (c / n_refseq)
```

Where n_input = total input genes, n_refseq = total RefSeq genes.

### Interpretation

| Fold Enrichment | Interpretation                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| >10x            | Very strong enrichment, likely direct regulatory relationship |
| 5-10x           | Strong enrichment, good evidence for regulation               |
| 2-5x            | Moderate enrichment, possible regulation                      |
| <2x             | Weak enrichment, may be background                            |
| <1x             | Depletion (API reports as ~1e-06 for zero overlap)            |
| >100,000x       | **Sentinel value** — see below                                |

### Sentinel Values

When the background overlap (c in the contingency table) is zero — meaning no
RefSeq genes have peaks for that experiment in the queried regions — the fold
enrichment formula produces division by zero. The API reports an extremely large
value (typically 1,000,000x) as a sentinel.

**How to identify sentinel values:**

- Fold enrichment ≥ 100,000x
- Typically low overlap count (e.g., 1/19 genes)
- Often non-significant Q-value (q > 0.05)

**How these are handled:**

- Results are sorted by Q-value (not fold enrichment), so sentinels are
  deprioritized
- Top-20 and visualization panels require minimum 2 gene overlaps
- Scatter and volcano plots cap fold enrichment at 1,000x for display

## P-value Thresholds

| P-value   | Significance Level          |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| p < 0.001 | Highly significant (\*\*\*) |
| p < 0.01  | Significant (\*\*)          |
| p < 0.05  | Nominally significant (\*)  |
| p >= 0.05 | Not significant (ns)        |

## Overlap Rate

Fraction of input genes with at least one overlapping peak from an experiment:

```
overlap_rate = regions_with_overlaps / total_input_genes
```

## API Output Columns

The API returns 11 tab-separated columns (no header):

1. Experiment ID (SRX...)
2. Antigen class (e.g., "TFs and others")
3. Antigen name
4. Cell type class (e.g., "Blood")
5. Cell type (e.g., "K-562")
6. Number of peaks
7. Input overlap (e.g., "4/5" = 4 of 5 input genes)
8. Background overlap (e.g., "10/18851")
9. log10(P-value)
10. log10(Q-value)
11. Fold enrichment

## Data Biases

ChIP-Atlas enrichment results are influenced by the composition of public
ChIP-seq data:

- **Well-studied factors are over-represented.** TFs like TP53, RELA (NF-κB),
  and CTCF have hundreds to thousands of public experiments, while less-studied
  factors may have only a few. A factor appearing enriched may partly reflect
  data availability rather than biological specificity.
- **Common cell types dominate.** Cell lines like K-562, HeLa, and MCF-7
  contribute disproportionately to the database. Enrichment in these cell types
  is more likely to be detected simply due to more available data.
- **Publication bias.** Experiments in public databases skew toward positive
  results and well-characterized regulatory relationships.

**Recommendations:**

- Use Q-value ranking (not fold enrichment) to prioritize results
- Consider the number of available experiments when interpreting factor
  importance
- Validate key findings with orthogonal methods (expression data, perturbation
  experiments, motif analysis)
