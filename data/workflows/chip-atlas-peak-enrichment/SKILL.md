# ChIP-Atlas Peak Enrichment

Find ChIP-seq peak enrichment near your genes using the official ChIP-Atlas Enrichment Analysis API.

## When to Use This Skill

Use ChIP-Atlas peak enrichment when you need to:
- **Identify transcription factors binding near your genes** from DE analysis or pathway results
- **Discover chromatin regulators** (TFs, histone modifications, chromatin remodelers) enriched near your gene set
- **Validate regulatory relationships** between factors and target genes using public ChIP-seq data
- **Find cell-type-specific regulators** by filtering to specific cell classes
- **Query 433,000+ ChIP-seq experiments** via the official API without manual downloads

**Don't use for:**
- Direct ChIP-seq analysis from raw reads (use peak calling workflows)
- Single gene lookups (use ChIP-Atlas web interface directly)
- Offline analysis (requires internet for API calls)

**Key Concept:** Submits your gene list to the ChIP-Atlas API, which performs Fisher's exact test enrichment analysis against all public ChIP-seq experiments. Returns fold enrichment, P-values, and BH-corrected Q-values.

## Clarification Questions

1. **Input Files** (ASK THIS FIRST):
   - Do you have a gene list to analyze?
   - Expected formats: Plain text (one gene per line), CSV with gene column, or DE results file
   - **Or use example data?** `tp53_targets` (5 genes, fast test) or `immune_response` (20 genes)

2. **Analysis parameters:**
   - **Species/genome?** Human hg38 (default), hg19, mouse mm10/mm9, rat rn6, fly, worm, yeast
   - **Experiment type?** "TFs and others" (default), "Histone", "ATAC-Seq"
   - **Cell type class?** "All cell types" (default), or specific: "Blood", "Neural", "Breast", etc.
   - **Peak threshold?** 50 (default, balanced), 100 (stringent), 200 (very stringent)
   - **TSS window?** 5000bp up/down (default), or custom distance_up/distance_down

## Standard Workflow

**Step 1 - Load data:**
```python
# Option 1: Example data
from scripts.load_example_data import load_example_data
data = load_example_data("tp53_targets")
gene_list = data['genes']

# Option 2: Your own genes
# from scripts.load_user_data import load_user_data
# gene_list = load_user_data("my_genes.txt")
```
**VERIFICATION:** `"Data loaded successfully: {N} genes"`

**Step 2 - Run enrichment analysis:**
```python
from scripts.run_enrichment_workflow import run_enrichment_workflow

results = run_enrichment_workflow(
    gene_list=gene_list,
    genome="hg38",
    antigen_class="TFs and others",
    cell_class="All cell types",
    threshold=50,
    output_dir="chipatlas_results"
)
```
**DO NOT write inline API query code. Just use the script.**

**VERIFICATION:** `"Enrichment analysis completed successfully!"`

**Step 3 - Generate visualizations:**
```python
from scripts.generate_all_plots import generate_all_plots
generate_all_plots(results, output_dir="chipatlas_results", top_n=15)
```
**DO NOT write inline plotting code. The script handles PNG + SVG with graceful fallback.**

**VERIFICATION:** `"All visualizations generated successfully!"`

**Step 4 - Export results:**
```python
from scripts.export_all import export_all
export_all(results, output_dir="chipatlas_results")
```
**DO NOT write custom export code. Use export_all().**

**VERIFICATION:** `"=== Export Complete ==="`

**IF SCRIPTS FAIL - Hierarchy:**
1. **Fix and Retry (90%)** - Install missing package, check internet, re-run
2. **Modify Script (5%)** - Edit the script, document changes
3. **Use as Reference (4%)** - Read script, adapt approach
4. **Write from Scratch (1%)** - Only if impossible, explain why

## Common Issues

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **API 400 error** | **Invalid parameters** | **Both antigenClass and cellClass must be non-empty. Use "All cell types" for all cells. See [references/chipatlas_metadata_format.md](references/chipatlas_metadata_format.md) for valid values.** |
| **API timeout (>10 min)** | **Large analysis or server load** | **Normal for "All cell types" with many experiments. Wait up to 10 minutes. Reduce scope by selecting specific cell_class.** |
| **Ensembl API timeout** | **Network or rate limiting** | **The workflow script automatically retries once after 60 seconds. If it still fails, the Ensembl step is skipped — enrichment results are unaffected but lack coordinate verification. Report this to the user (see interpretation rules).** |
| **Gene not found** | **Retired symbol or typo** | **Script auto-retries with known aliases (e.g., IL8→CXCL8). Check HGNC (genenames.org) for current symbol. Only affects input_regions, not enrichment results.** |
| **Fold enrichment >100,000x** | **Sentinel value (zero background overlap)** | **Not a real enrichment. Results are ranked by Q-value so these are deprioritized. Check overlap count — genuine hits have ≥2 gene overlaps.** |
| **No significant enrichments** | **Gene set not enriched** | **Try: (1) Lower threshold (50), (2) Widen TSS window, (3) Check if genes are regulatory targets.** |
| **SVG export error** | **Missing optional dependency** | **Normal - `generate_all_plots()` handles fallback automatically. Both PNG and SVG attempted; PNG always created.** |

## Interpretation Guidelines

**Q-value (BH-corrected, primary ranking):** <0.001 highly significant, <0.01 significant, <0.05 genome-wide significant
**Fold Enrichment:** >10x very strong, 5-10x strong, 2-5x moderate, <2x weak, >100,000x likely sentinel value (zero background overlap)
**Overlap Rate:** >50% core regulon, 20-50% key targets, <20% subset/indirect
**Threshold:** Controls MACS2 peak-calling stringency. Default 50 ≈ p<1e-5. See [references/peak_thresholds.md](references/peak_thresholds.md).

**⚠️ CRITICAL — When summarizing results to the user:**
- **Explain threshold meaning on first mention.** When first discussing the threshold in your interpretation, state what it means in practical terms (e.g., "threshold=50 corresponds to MACS2 peak-calling at approximately p < 1e-5, balancing sensitivity and specificity"). Do not defer this explanation to a caveats section only.
- **Cite overlap rates from `summary_report.md`.** Use the "Overlap Rate Summary" section for aggregate statistics. Do NOT round up or generalize (e.g., do not say "70–95%" if the report shows median 53%).
- **Distinguish experiments from factors.** Multiple experiments for the same TF are independent datasets, not independent regulators. Use the "Top Factors (aggregated)" table when reporting unique factor counts.
- **Acknowledge data availability bias.** If a factor has many experiments (>20), note that its prominence partly reflects being well-studied. Cite the experiment count from the aggregated table.
- **Use Median FE (Sig), not Median FE (All), to judge enrichment strength.** The aggregated table has two FE columns: "Median FE (Sig)" uses only significant experiments (q < 0.05), while "Median FE (All)" averages across all experiments with ≥2 overlaps including non-significant ones. For factors with many experiments but few significant (e.g., Experiments=137, Sig=5), the "All" median is diluted by non-significant experiments and will dramatically understate actual enrichment. **Do not conclude "weak enrichment" from a low Median FE (All) when Median FE (Sig) shows strong enrichment.** Always cite Median FE (Sig) when discussing a factor's enrichment strength.
- **Flag high experiment count with few significant.** If a factor has many experiments (>20) but few are significant (Sig column), note that most experiments for this factor do not show enrichment near these genes — only a subset of cell types/conditions do. Compare the Sig vs Experiments columns across factors to illustrate specificity differences.
- **Report gene discrepancies.** If the summary report shows the API used fewer regions than genes submitted, mention this to the user with possible causes. Do NOT speculate about which specific gene was dropped — the API does not report this information.
- **Report Ensembl vs API region count discrepancies prominently.** The Ensembl coordinate lookup and the ChIP-Atlas API use **different gene databases** (Ensembl vs RefSeq). Discrepancies are expected and should be explained clearly:
  - If Ensembl mapped **0 genes** while the API analyzed N: explain that these are independent systems; enrichment results are valid but lack independent coordinate verification. Do not dismiss this as merely "optional."
  - If Ensembl mapped **fewer genes** than the API (e.g., 4/5 vs 5/5): explain that the discrepancy reflects different database coverage — a gene may exist in RefSeq but have a failed/timed-out Ensembl lookup, or vice versa. State which system mapped how many genes and that the enrichment results use the API's own RefSeq mapping (not Ensembl).
  - In both cases, the enrichment results themselves are valid. The Ensembl step provides independent verification only.
- **Distinguish data-derived findings from background knowledge.** If citing known biology to interpret results, explicitly flag it as "from prior knowledge" or "based on known biology," not a conclusion from this analysis. Examples requiring explicit flagging: "TP63 and TP73 share the same DNA-binding domain as TP53" (protein family knowledge), "BRD4 is a bromodomain protein that binds acetylated histones at active promoters" (general factor biology), "these are canonical NF-κB targets" (pathway knowledge). Every such claim needs a phrase like "from prior knowledge of p53 family biology" — do not let background claims blend implicitly with data-derived findings.
- **Report the total count of significant factors, not just the top 10.** The aggregated table shows the top 10, but the summary report header states the total count (e.g., "Top 10 of 29 significantly enriched factors"). Always report this total — do not say "10 factors were identified" when more exist. Mention notable omissions if biologically relevant factors appear in the full `enrichment_results_significant.csv`.
- **Discuss all factors in the aggregated top table.** Every factor in the "Top Factors (aggregated)" table should be mentioned or briefly acknowledged. Do not silently omit factors — if one is less biologically interpretable, note that rather than skipping it.
- **Note multiple testing across aggregated factors.** The Q-values in the aggregated table are BH-corrected across experiments, not across factors. Each factor's "best Q-value" is cherry-picked from its most significant experiment. Interpreting all 10 top factors as independent discoveries overstates confidence — note this when presenting the aggregated table (e.g., "these per-experiment Q-values do not account for testing across multiple factors").
- **Small gene sets (≤10 genes): Lead with exploratory framing and connect every moderate-enrichment discussion to this caveat.** Frame the analysis as exploratory/demonstrative, not a powered study. **Your opening summary MUST lead with the exploratory nature** (e.g., "As an exploratory analysis with only 5 genes..." or "This demonstration-scale analysis with N genes identified...") rather than leading with the count of significant enrichments, which sounds more impressive than warranted at small N. Each gene contributes a large fraction of the overlap rate, so individual gene inclusion/exclusion substantially changes results. State this limitation prominently — do not bury it in a caveats section at the end. **Every time you discuss a factor with moderate fold enrichment (2–10x), you MUST explicitly note** that with only N input genes, a single gene's inclusion/exclusion could eliminate the signal entirely (e.g., "with only 5 input genes, this moderate enrichment should be interpreted with extra caution — removing a single gene could eliminate the signal").
- **Cite ChIP-Atlas publications.** When presenting results, cite the database: Zou et al. (2024) for ChIP-Atlas 3.0 and Oki et al. (2018) for the original ChIP-Atlas. Include these in any written summary or report to acknowledge the data source.

**Caveats (MUST include in any results summary):**
- Results biased toward well-studied factors and common cell types. Heavily studied TFs may appear enriched partly due to data availability (more experiments = more chances to be significant).
- Multiple experiments per factor are independent datasets, not independent biological signals. Use the aggregated factor table for deduplicated counts.
- Results depend on the peak-calling threshold used. Discuss the threshold chosen and note that results may differ at other stringencies.
- Validate key findings with orthogonal methods (expression, perturbation, motif analysis).

## Suggested Next Steps

1. **Threshold sensitivity check** — Re-run at threshold=100 or 200 to test whether top factors remain significant at more stringent peak-calling cutoffs. Offer this to the user as a robustness check (e.g., "Would you like me to re-run at threshold=100 to confirm these findings are robust?").
2. **Validate top factors** with literature, expression correlation, perturbation data
3. **Cell-type-specific analysis** with `cell_class` matching your experimental system
4. **Motif analysis** of promoter regions for top factor binding motifs
5. **Regulatory network** construction with top factors and target genes
