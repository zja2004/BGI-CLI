## Why Multiple Testing Correction?

### The Multiple Testing Problem

**Key insight:** When testing many hypotheses simultaneously, some will appear
significant by chance even if no true effects exist.

**Example:**

- Test 20,000 genes for differential expression at α = 0.05
- If NO genes are truly DE, expect 1,000 false positives (5% of 20,000)
- Without correction, results are mostly noise

**Genomics scale:**

- RNA-seq: ~15,000-20,000 gene tests
- ATAC-seq: ~50,000-150,000 peak tests
- Methylation arrays: ~450,000-850,000 CpG tests
- GWAS: ~500,000-10,000,000 SNP tests

### Type I Error (False Positive)

**Definition:** Rejecting null hypothesis when it's actually true (claiming
effect when none exists)

**Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER):**

- Probability of making ≥1 false positive among all tests
- With m independent tests at α = 0.05: FWER = 1 - (0.95)^m
- For m = 20: FWER ≈ 0.64 (64% chance of false positive)
- For m = 100: FWER ≈ 0.994 (virtually guaranteed false positive)

**Consequence:** Need more stringent thresholds to control error rate

---

## Multiple Testing Correction Methods

### Bonferroni Correction

**Method:** Divide α by number of tests

**Formula:** α_corrected = α / m, where m = number of tests

**Example:**

- 20,000 tests, α = 0.05
- Bonferroni threshold: 0.05 / 20,000 = 2.5 × 10^-6
- Reject null if p < 2.5 × 10^-6

**Properties:** ✅ Controls FWER (probability of ANY false positive) ✅ Very
simple and transparent ✅ Makes no assumptions about test dependence ❌
Extremely conservative (low power) ❌ Many false negatives (misses true effects)
❌ Not recommended for genomics (too stringent)

**When to use:**

- Small number of tests (m < 100)
- Candidate gene studies where FWER control critical
- Situations where false positives very costly

### Benjamini-Hochberg FDR

**Method:** Control False Discovery Rate (expected proportion of false positives
among discoveries)

**FDR Definition:** E[FP / (FP + TP)] where FP = false positives, TP = true
positives

**Procedure:**

1. Order p-values: p*(1) ≤ p*(2) ≤ ... ≤ p\_(m)
2. Find largest k where: p\_(k) ≤ (k/m) × α
3. Reject hypotheses 1, 2, ..., k

**Example:**

- α = 0.05 (control FDR at 5%)
- If 1000 genes called significant, expect ~50 are false positives
- But 950 are likely true positives

**Properties:** ✅ Much more powerful than Bonferroni ✅ Optimal under
independence ✅ Still controls error rate under positive dependence ✅ Standard
choice for genomics ✅ Balances false positives and false negatives well

**When to use:**

- Standard choice for RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq
- When you can tolerate some false positives
- Exploratory discovery experiments
- Most published genomics studies

**R implementation:**

```r
adjusted_p <- p.adjust(pvalues, method = "BH")
significant <- adjusted_p < 0.05
```

### q-value (Storey's Method)

**Method:** Enhanced FDR estimation accounting for proportion of true nulls

**Key innovation:** Estimates π0 (proportion of truly null hypotheses) from
p-value distribution

**Advantage over BH:**

- If π0 < 1 (some true effects exist), more powerful than BH
- Provides q-value (minimum FDR at which test is significant)
- More accurate FDR estimates

**Properties:** ✅ More powerful than BH when many true effects ✅ Provides
interpretable q-values ✅ Handles positive dependence ❌ Requires good p-value
calibration ❌ Can be unstable with small sample sizes

**When to use:**

- RNA-seq with expected many DE genes (>10%)
- Large sample sizes (n ≥ 5 per group)
- When BH is too conservative

**R implementation:**

```r
library(qvalue)
qobj <- qvalue(p = pvalues)
qvalues <- qobj$qvalues
significant <- qvalues < 0.05
```

### Independent Hypothesis Weighting (IHW)

**Method:** Data-driven weighting that increases power by upweighting more
promising tests

**Key innovation:** Uses covariate (e.g., mean expression) to prioritize
hypotheses without looking at p-values

**How it works:**

1. Stratify tests by covariate (mean expression, peak strength, etc.)
2. Learn optimal weights for each stratum using independent data
3. Weight hypotheses before FDR correction
4. Higher weight = higher priority = more power to detect

**Properties:** ✅ Can increase discoveries by 10-50% over BH ✅ Still controls
FDR rigorously ✅ Uses information in data without inflating error ✅ Works with
DESeq2, edgeR outputs ❌ Requires careful covariate selection ❌ More complex
than BH

**When to use:**

- RNA-seq when mean expression varies widely
- ATAC-seq when peak strengths vary
- Any setting with informative covariate
- Want maximum power while controlling FDR

**R implementation:**

```r
library(IHW)
ihw_res <- ihw(
  pvalues = pvalues,
  covariates = mean_expression,  # Must be independent of p-value under null
  alpha = 0.05
)
significant <- adj_pvalues(ihw_res) < 0.05
```

**Important:** Covariate must be independent of p-value under null hypothesis

- ✅ Good: Mean expression (independent of DE status under null)
- ✅ Good: Peak width, GC content (independent of accessibility)
- ❌ Bad: Effect size (correlated with p-value)
- ❌ Bad: Test statistic (directly related to p-value)

### Local FDR (lfdr)

**Method:** Estimates probability that each specific test is a false positive

**Distinction from FDR:**

- FDR: Expected proportion of FP among all rejections (global)
- lfdr: Probability that THIS specific test is FP (local)

**Properties:** ✅ Provides test-specific error estimates ✅ Can be more
powerful in some settings ❌ Requires good p-value density estimation ❌ Less
commonly used in practice ❌ Harder to interpret

**When to use:**

- Prioritizing individual genes for follow-up
- Want error estimate for each specific test
- Comfortable with Bayesian interpretation

### Recommendations by Assay

**Bulk RNA-seq:**

- **Standard:** BH-FDR at q < 0.05 or q < 0.1
- **Higher power:** IHW with mean expression as covariate
- **Conservative:** q-value if many DE genes expected

**Single-cell RNA-seq:**

- **Standard:** BH-FDR at q < 0.05
- **Cell type markers:** BH-FDR at q < 0.01 (more stringent)
- **Avoid:** Very stringent thresholds (power already low due to dropout)

**ATAC-seq:**

- **Standard:** BH-FDR at q < 0.05
- **Higher power:** IHW with peak signal strength as covariate
- **Conservative:** BH-FDR at q < 0.01 for high-confidence peaks

**ChIP-seq:**

- **Narrow peaks:** BH-FDR at q < 0.05 (or q < 0.01 for TF binding)
- **Broad peaks:** BH-FDR at q < 0.1 (more lenient, broader features)
- **Differential binding:** BH-FDR at q < 0.05

**Methylation:**

- **Array (450K/EPIC):** BH-FDR at q < 0.05 (or IHW)
- **WGBS:** BH-FDR at q < 0.01 (millions of tests, be more stringent)

**GWAS:**

- **Genome-wide:** Bonferroni at p < 5 × 10^-8 (traditional threshold)
- **Candidate regions:** BH-FDR at q < 0.05

## Significance Thresholds

### Common FDR Thresholds

**q < 0.05 (5% FDR):**

- Standard for most genomics applications
- Balance between sensitivity and specificity
- Among 1000 discoveries, expect ~50 false positives
- **Recommended as default**

**q < 0.1 (10% FDR):**

- More lenient, higher power
- Useful for exploratory studies
- Pilot experiments to generate hypotheses
- Among 1000 discoveries, expect ~100 false positives

**q < 0.01 (1% FDR):**

- More stringent, lower power
- High-confidence discoveries
- Follow-up validation studies
- When false positives are costly

### Choosing Your Threshold

**Use q < 0.05 when:**

- Standard discovery experiment
- Balancing sensitivity and specificity
- Following literature precedent
- Grant or publication

**Use q < 0.1 when:**

- Exploratory or pilot study
- Sample size limited (low power)
- Generating hypotheses for follow-up
- Biology expected to be subtle

**Use q < 0.01 when:**

- High-confidence hits needed
- Follow-up experiments costly
- Clinical or translational application
- Avoiding false positives critical

## Implementation in Common Tools

### DESeq2 (RNA-seq)

**Standard BH-FDR:**

```r
library(DESeq2)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
res <- results(dds, alpha = 0.05)  # BH-FDR at 5%
significant <- res[res$padj < 0.05 & !is.na(res$padj), ]
```

**With IHW:**

```r
library(DESeq2)
library(IHW)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
res <- results(dds, filterFun = ihw)  # Automatic IHW
significant <- res[res$padj < 0.05 & !is.na(res$padj), ]
```

**With lfcShrink (adaptive shrinkage):**

```r
res <- lfcShrink(dds, coef = "condition_treatment_vs_control", type = "apeglm")
# Shrinks LFC, improves power for small effects
significant <- res[res$padj < 0.05 & !is.na(res$padj), ]
```

### edgeR (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq)

**Standard BH-FDR:**

```r
library(edgeR)
fit <- glmQLFit(dge, design)
qlf <- glmQLFTest(fit, coef = 2)
results <- topTags(qlf, n = Inf, adjust.method = "BH")
significant <- results$table[results$table$FDR < 0.05, ]
```

### limma (Microarray, RNA-seq)

**Standard BH-FDR:**

```r
library(limma)
fit <- lmFit(eset, design)
fit2 <- eBayes(fit)
results <- topTable(fit2, coef = 2, adjust.method = "BH", n = Inf)
significant <- results[results$adj.P.Val < 0.05, ]
```

### Manual Correction

**For any p-values:**

```r
# Benjamini-Hochberg
adjusted_p <- p.adjust(pvalues, method = "BH")

# Bonferroni
adjusted_p <- p.adjust(pvalues, method = "bonferroni")

# Or using multtest package
library(multtest)
adjusted_p <- mt.rawp2adjp(pvalues, proc = "BH")
```

## Interpreting Results

### What Does q < 0.05 Mean?

**Correct interpretation:**

- "Among all genes I call significant at q < 0.05, I expect ~5% are false
  positives"
- "The FDR for my set of discoveries is controlled at 5%"
- "If I report 100 significant genes, ~5 are likely false positives (but I don't
  know which ones)"

**Incorrect interpretations:**

- ❌ "This gene has a 5% chance of being a false positive" (that's local FDR,
  not FDR)
- ❌ "I have 95% confidence this effect is real" (not a confidence statement)
- ❌ "P < 0.05 after correction" (q-value is not a p-value)

### Reporting Significant Genes

**In results section:**

> "We identified 1,247 differentially expressed genes at FDR < 0.05
> (Benjamini-Hochberg correction). Of these, 687 were upregulated and 560 were
> downregulated in the treatment group."

**In methods section:**

> "Differential expression was assessed using DESeq2 v1.36.0 with default
> parameters. P-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the
> Benjamini-Hochberg method, and genes with adjusted p-value (q-value) < 0.05
> were considered significant."

**With IHW:**

> "We used Independent Hypothesis Weighting (IHW) with mean expression as the
> covariate to increase power while controlling FDR at 5%. This approach
> identified 1,512 significant genes compared to 1,247 with standard
> Benjamini-Hochberg correction, representing a 21% increase in discoveries."

### Volcano Plots and Multiple Testing

**Standard volcano plot:**

- X-axis: log2 fold change
- Y-axis: -log10(adjusted p-value) NOT raw p-value
- Horizontal line at -log10(0.05) = 1.3 for q < 0.05
- Points above line and left/right of FC threshold are significant

**Correct labeling:**

- ✅ "FDR < 0.05" or "q < 0.05" or "Adjusted p < 0.05"
- ❌ "p < 0.05" (ambiguous, sounds like unadjusted)

## Special Considerations

### What If Nothing Is Significant?

**Possible reasons:**

1. **Underpowered study** - Need more samples or depth
2. **No true biological effect** - Null hypothesis is true
3. **High variability** - Biological or technical noise too large
4. **Poor quality data** - Technical issues masking signal
5. **Wrong comparison** - Testing wrong contrast or timepoint

**What NOT to do:** ❌ Relax correction threshold arbitrarily (q < 0.2, q < 0.5,
etc.) ❌ Report "trends" or "marginally significant" results ❌ Switch to
uncorrected p-values ❌ Cherry-pick genes of interest and claim they're
significant

**What to do instead:** ✅ Report that no genes met significance threshold ✅
Examine power analysis - was study adequately powered? ✅ Look at top genes
(ranked by p-value) for biological interpretation ✅ Consider effect sizes - are
effects too small to detect? ✅ Run QC - are there technical issues? ✅ Design
better follow-up experiment

### Stratified Multiple Testing

**Scenario:** Testing in multiple contexts (multiple cell types, tissues,
conditions)

**Approach 1: Correct within each stratum**

- Test each cell type separately
- Apply FDR correction within each
- Appropriate when strata are independent questions

**Approach 2: Correct across all tests**

- Pool all tests from all strata
- Apply single FDR correction
- More conservative but controls overall FDR

**Example:**

- Testing DE in 10 cell types (15,000 genes × 10 = 150,000 tests)
- Within-stratum: BH-FDR within each cell type (10 separate corrections)
- Across-stratum: BH-FDR across all 150,000 tests (one correction)

**Recommendation:**

- Use within-stratum if strata represent distinct biological questions
- Use across-stratum if want to control overall false discovery rate

### Pre-Filtering to Reduce Tests

**Motivation:** Reduce number of tests to increase power

**Common filters:**

- RNA-seq: Remove genes with very low counts (e.g., < 10 reads across all
  samples)
- ATAC-seq: Remove peaks with very low signal
- Methylation: Remove probes with known SNPs or cross-reactivity

**Legality:** Filtering is valid if done on covariate INDEPENDENT of test
statistic under null

- ✅ Mean expression (independent of DE under null)
- ✅ Peak width (independent of differential accessibility)
- ❌ Fold change (directly related to test statistic)
- ❌ P-value (obviously invalid)

**Impact:** Can increase power by removing uninformative tests

**Implementation in DESeq2:**

```r
# DESeq2 automatically does independent filtering
res <- results(dds, independentFiltering = TRUE)  # Default
```

## Advanced Topics

### Multiple Testing in scRNA-seq

**Unique challenges:**

- Testing in many cell types increases multiple testing burden
- Sparse data (dropout) reduces power
- Pseudobulk vs. single-cell methods have different multiple testing
  considerations

**Recommendations:**

1. **Use pseudobulk approach** when possible (aggregate cells to sample level)
   - Reduces total number of tests
   - Better power
   - Apply standard BH-FDR

2. **For single-cell methods** (cell-level tests):
   - Still use BH-FDR
   - May need more lenient threshold (q < 0.1)
   - Consider effect size thresholds (fold-change > 1.5) in addition to q-value

3. **For multi-cell-type analyses:**
   - Correct within each cell type (recommended)
   - Or correct across all tests (more conservative)

### Empirical Bayes and Shrinkage Methods

**Motivation:** Borrow information across genes to improve power

**Methods:**

- **DESeq2 lfcShrink:** Shrinks log fold changes toward zero, improves power
- **limma eBayes:** Shrinks variance estimates, increases degrees of freedom
- **ashr (adaptive shrinkage):** Flexible shrinkage improving power

**Benefit:** Better power for small effects while controlling FDR

**Usage:**

```r
# DESeq2 with apeglm shrinkage
res <- lfcShrink(dds, coef = "condition_treatment_vs_control", type = "apeglm")
# Then apply standard FDR threshold
significant <- res[res$padj < 0.05 & !is.na(res$padj), ]
```

### Hierarchical Testing

**Scenario:** Testing at multiple levels (gene → pathway, SNP → gene → region)

**Approach:** Use hierarchical FDR control

1. Test at finest level (genes)
2. Aggregate to higher level (pathways)
3. Control FDR at each level

**Benefit:** Increases power to detect effects at different scales

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Not Correcting at All

❌ **Wrong:** Report genes with p < 0.05 without correction

**Why it's wrong:** Almost all results are likely false positives

✅ **Correct:** Always apply multiple testing correction in genomics

### Mistake 2: Correcting Multiple Times

❌ **Wrong:** Apply BH-FDR in DESeq2, then apply again manually

**Why it's wrong:** Double correction is too conservative

✅ **Correct:** DESeq2 `padj` column already contains corrected values - use
directly

### Mistake 3: Choosing Threshold After Seeing Results

❌ **Wrong:** Try q < 0.05 (nothing significant), switch to q < 0.1 or q < 0.2

**Why it's wrong:** Post-hoc threshold selection inflates false positives

✅ **Correct:** Pre-specify threshold (typically q < 0.05), stick with it

### Mistake 4: Reporting "Trends"

❌ **Wrong:** "Gene X showed a trend toward significance (q = 0.08)"

**Why it's wrong:** Non-significant is non-significant; "trend" is not a
statistical term

✅ **Correct:** Report as not significant, or examine in exploratory manner

### Mistake 5: Mixing Corrected and Uncorrected

❌ **Wrong:** Use FDR for RNA-seq but raw p-values for qPCR validation

**Why it's wrong:** Inconsistent error control

✅ **Correct:** Use appropriate correction for each experiment scale

---

## Validation and Orthogonal Evidence

### Multiple Testing in Validation Experiments

**Key principle:** Validation experiments test fewer hypotheses, need less
stringent correction

**Example workflow:**

1. Discovery (RNA-seq): Test 20,000 genes with BH-FDR at q < 0.05 → 1000
   significant genes
2. Select top 20 genes for qPCR validation
3. Validation: Test 20 genes with Bonferroni correction (α = 0.05/20 = 0.0025)

**Rationale:**

- Discovery phase: Exploratory, many tests, use FDR
- Validation phase: Confirmatory, few tests, use FWER (Bonferroni)

### Building Evidence Without Correction

**When minimal correction acceptable:**

- Orthogonal evidence supports finding (proteomics confirms RNA-seq)
- Known biology supports result (gene is in relevant pathway)
- Spatial localization matches (ISH confirms RNA-seq)
- Functional validation (knockdown experiment confirms)

**Reporting:**

> "While Gene X did not reach genome-wide significance (q = 0.12), it was
> consistently upregulated across three independent cohorts (all nominal p <
> 0.01), and encodes a protein in the target pathway, making it a strong
> candidate for follow-up."
