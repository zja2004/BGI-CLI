# TWAS Hub Validation Guide

This document provides guidance on validating your TWAS results against
published studies from TWAS Hub.

## What is TWAS Hub?

[TWAS Hub](http://twas-hub.org/) is a centralized database aggregating published
TWAS results across multiple traits and tissues. It allows researchers to:

- **Validate findings**: Compare your results to published studies
- **Identify replication**: Assess which genes replicate known associations
- **Discover novelty**: Identify genes not previously reported
- **Check concordance**: Verify effect directions match published studies

---

## Key Distinction

- **Expression weights** (GTEx v8, PredictDB): Pre-computed prediction models
  used by all TWAS studies
- **TWAS associations** (TWAS Hub): Pre-computed gene-trait association results
  from specific published studies

Your analysis computes **fresh TWAS associations** using your GWAS data + shared
expression weights.

## When to Use TWAS Hub Validation

**Use when:**

- Your trait is available in TWAS Hub (common diseases/traits)
- Publishing results (shows replication of known associations)
- Prioritizing novel vs. known discoveries
- Comparing power to previous studies

**Skip when:**

- Novel trait not in TWAS Hub
- Time-sensitive exploratory analysis
- Using TWAS only for hypothesis generation

## Interpretation Guidelines

### Replication Rate

- **>70%**: Strong validation - findings align with literature
- **40-70%**: Moderate - may reflect differences in:
  - Ancestry populations
  - Sample size
  - Phenotype definitions
- **<40%**: Low - investigate potential issues

### Novel Discoveries

Genes significant in your study but not in published TWAS:

- May represent true biological discoveries
- Could reflect increased statistical power
- Warrant follow-up validation with colocalization/MR

### Effect Concordance

Proportion of replicated genes with same effect direction:

- **>80%**: Expected for well-powered studies
- **<80%**: Suggests allele harmonization issues or population differences

## Common Issues

| Issue              | Cause                       | Solution                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Low replication    | Different trait definitions | Check phenotype compatibility |
| Effect discordance | Allele flip                 | Re-check allele harmonization |
| All genes novel    | Trait mismatch              | Verify correct trait ID       |
| No overlap         | Different tissues           | Confirm tissue matches        |
