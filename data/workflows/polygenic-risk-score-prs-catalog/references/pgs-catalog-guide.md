# PGS Catalog Guide

## What is the PGS Catalog?

The PGS Catalog (https://www.pgscatalog.org/) is an open database of published
polygenic scores. It provides:

- **5,000+ scoring files** for hundreds of traits
- **Harmonized weights** mapped to standard genome builds (GRCh37, GRCh38)
- **Metadata** including publication, method, sample sizes, and performance
  metrics
- **REST API** for programmatic access

## Finding PGS Scores

### Using the Search Function

```r
source("scripts/load_pgs_weights.R")

# Search by trait name
scores <- search_pgs_catalog("coronary artery disease")
scores <- search_pgs_catalog("type 2 diabetes")
scores <- search_pgs_catalog("LDL cholesterol")
```

### Choosing the Best Score

When multiple scores are available for a trait, consider:

1. **Sample size:** Larger GWAS discovery samples generally yield better PRS
2. **Method:** Bayesian methods (LDpred2, PRS-CS, SBayesR) often outperform C+T
3. **Validation:** Check if the score has been validated in independent cohorts
4. **Variant count:** More variants isn't always better — method matters more
5. **Population:** Scores derived from diverse or ancestry-matched GWAS are
   preferable
6. **Recency:** Newer scores may benefit from larger GWAS and improved methods

### PGS ID Format

- Format: `PGS` followed by 6 digits (e.g., `PGS000018`)
- Lower numbers were deposited earlier; higher numbers are newer
- Publication-linked: each score is tied to a specific publication

## Harmonized Scoring Files

### File Format

PGS Catalog harmonized files contain:

- `hm_chr` — Chromosome (harmonized)
- `hm_pos` — Position (harmonized to GRCh37 or GRCh38)
- `effect_allele` — Allele that the weight applies to
- `other_allele` — Reference/non-effect allele
- `effect_weight` — PRS weight (log-OR for binary traits, beta for continuous)
- `hm_rsID` — rsID (harmonized)

### Genome Build

- **GRCh37 (hg19):** Default for 1000 Genomes Phase 3 and most older GWAS
- **GRCh38 (hg38):** Newer reference; some scores only available in this build
- Always match the genome build between scoring file and target genotypes

## REST API

### Score Metadata

```
GET https://www.pgscatalog.org/rest/score/{pgs_id}
```

Returns: name, trait, method, variants count, publication, FTP URLs

### Trait Search

```
GET https://www.pgscatalog.org/rest/trait/search?term={query}
```

Returns: matching traits with associated PGS IDs

### Rate Limiting

- The API has rate limits; avoid rapid sequential requests
- The `search_pgs_catalog()` function limits to 20 score lookups per search

## Demo Trait Configuration

The default cardiometabolic panel includes:

| Trait                   | Short Name | PGS ID    | Notes                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| Coronary Artery Disease | CAD        | PGS000018 | Khera et al. 2018     |
| Type 2 Diabetes         | T2D        | PGS000014 | Mahajan et al. 2018   |
| LDL Cholesterol         | LDL        | PGS000062 | GLGC                  |
| Body Mass Index         | BMI        | PGS000027 | Khera et al. 2019     |
| Systolic Blood Pressure | SBP        | PGS000299 | Evangelou et al. 2018 |

If any PGS ID becomes unavailable, use `search_pgs_catalog()` to find
alternatives.

## Troubleshooting Downloads

| Issue          | Solution                                                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 404 error      | PGS ID may be wrong or harmonized file unavailable for requested build        |
| Timeout        | Set `options(timeout = 900)` — genome-wide scores can be 100MB+               |
| Parse error    | Ensure correct skip of `#` header lines (handled by `download_pgs_weights()`) |
| Low match rate | Check genome build alignment between weights and genotypes                    |
