## Spatial Neighbors Graph

The spatial neighbors graph defines which spots are considered "neighbors" in
tissue space. This graph underpins all downstream spatial analyses (SVGs,
neighborhood enrichment, co-occurrence).

### Coordinate Types

| `coord_type` | When to Use                 | Description                                                            |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `'grid'`     | **Visium** (hexagonal grid) | Uses array row/col indices. Default `n_neighs=6` for hexagonal layout. |
| `'generic'`  | Slide-seq, MERFISH, custom  | Uses spatial coordinates directly. Requires `n_neighs` or `radius`.    |

**Visium default:**
`sq.gr.spatial_neighbors(adata, coord_type='grid', n_neighs=6)` — each spot
connects to its 6 hexagonal neighbors.

### Parameters

- **`n_neighs`** (default: 6 for grid): Number of neighbors per spot. For
  Visium, 6 matches the hexagonal geometry. Increase to 12-18 for second-ring
  neighbors.
- **`n_rings`** (default: 1): Number of hexagonal rings around each spot (Visium
  only). `n_rings=2` captures broader spatial context.
- **`radius`** (generic only): Fixed distance radius for neighborhood
  definition. Used when `coord_type='generic'`.

## Spatially Variable Genes (Moran's I)

### What Is Moran's I?

Moran's I measures spatial autocorrelation — whether a gene's expression is
spatially clustered, dispersed, or random across the tissue.

| Moran's I Value | Interpretation                                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Close to **+1** | **Clustered** — high values near high, low near low (strong spatial pattern) |
| Close to **0**  | **Random** — no spatial structure                                            |
| Close to **-1** | **Dispersed** — checkerboard pattern (high near low)                         |

### Statistical Significance

- **`n_perms`** (default: 100): Number of permutations for the null
  distribution. Higher = more accurate p-values but slower.
  - **Quick exploration:** `n_perms=100` (~1-2 min)
  - **Publication quality:** `n_perms=1000` (~10-15 min)
- **FDR correction:** Uses Benjamini-Hochberg (`pval_norm_fdr_bh`). Standard
  threshold: FDR < 0.05.
- **Alternative method:** Geary's C (`mode='geary'`) — similar but more
  sensitive to local differences. Use when Moran's I misses fine-grained
  patterns.

### Interpreting SVG Results

The output DataFrame (`adata.uns['moranI']`) contains:

| Column             | Description                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `I`                | Moran's I statistic (higher = more spatially structured) |
| `pval_norm`        | P-value from normal approximation                        |
| `pval_norm_fdr_bh` | FDR-corrected p-value                                    |
| `var_norm`         | Variance under normality assumption                      |

**Top SVGs** typically include:

- Tissue-specific markers (e.g., cardiomyocyte genes in heart)
- Extracellular matrix genes at tissue boundaries
- Immune markers in infiltrated regions

## Neighborhood Enrichment

### What It Measures

Neighborhood enrichment quantifies whether two cluster types are **spatially
co-localized** (positive z-score) or **spatially segregated** (negative z-score)
beyond what's expected by chance.

### Interpreting Z-Scores

| Z-score     | Interpretation                                            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **> 2**     | Significantly co-localized (clusters tend to be adjacent) |
| **-2 to 2** | No significant spatial preference                         |
| **< -2**    | Significantly segregated (clusters avoid each other)      |

### Biological Examples (Cardiac Tissue)

- **Cardiomyocyte ↔ Fibroblast:** Positive enrichment at infarct border zone
- **Endothelial ↔ Cardiomyocyte:** Positive enrichment (vascular proximity)
- **Immune ↔ Remote myocardium:** Negative enrichment (immune infiltration
  localized to injury)

---

## Co-occurrence Analysis

### What It Measures

Co-occurrence computes the probability of observing two cluster types within
increasing spatial distances. Unlike neighborhood enrichment (binary
adjacent/not), co-occurrence captures **distance-dependent** spatial
relationships.

### Interpreting Co-occurrence Curves

- **Probability > expected:** Clusters co-occur more than random at that
  distance
- **Probability < expected:** Clusters avoid each other at that distance
- **Distance-dependent patterns:** Clusters may co-occur at short range but
  segregate at long range (e.g., border zone cell types)

### Known Issues

- `n_splits` parameter can cause NaN values in some squidpy versions — use the
  default value
- Very small clusters (< 10 spots) produce noisy co-occurrence estimates

## Parameter Tuning Guide

### QC Filtering

| Parameter      | Typical Range | Heart Tissue | Notes                                          |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `min_genes`    | 200-500       | 200          | Lower for sparse tissues                       |
| `min_cells`    | 3-20          | 10           | Higher removes noise genes                     |
| `max_pct_mito` | 10-30%        | 50%          | Cardiac tissue has naturally high MT (~30-40%) |

**Cardiac-specific:** Heart tissue has naturally high mitochondrial content
(~30-40% median) due to the energy demands of cardiomyocytes. The default
`max_pct_mito=50%` retains >95% of spots. For non-cardiac tissues (brain, liver,
immune), use 20% instead.

### Clustering

| Parameter     | Range   | Default | Effect                        |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| `resolution`  | 0.2-2.0 | 0.8     | Higher = more clusters        |
| `n_neighbors` | 5-30    | 15      | Higher = smoother clusters    |
| `n_pcs`       | 10-50   | 30      | Higher captures more variance |

**Spatial data:** Lower resolution (0.5-0.8) often produces more biologically
interpretable spatial domains than high resolution. Check that clusters
correspond to visible tissue regions in the H&E image.

### HVG Selection

| Parameter     | Range       | Default     | Notes                                             |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `n_top_genes` | 1000-3000   | 2000        | Standard for Visium (~33K genes)                  |
| `flavor`      | `seurat_v3` | `seurat_v3` | Works on raw counts; recommended for spatial data |

## Advanced Options

### Alternative Autocorrelation: Geary's C

```python
sq.gr.spatial_autocorr(adata, mode='geary', n_perms=100)
# Results in adata.uns['gearyC']
```

Geary's C is more sensitive to **local** spatial differences while Moran's I
captures **global** spatial patterns. Consider running both for comprehensive
SVG detection.

### Custom Spatial Graphs

For non-standard spatial layouts (e.g., multiple tissue sections merged):

```python
# Fixed radius neighbors
sq.gr.spatial_neighbors(adata, coord_type='generic', radius=150)

# KNN on coordinates
sq.gr.spatial_neighbors(adata, coord_type='generic', n_neighs=10)

# Delaunay triangulation
sq.gr.spatial_neighbors(adata, coord_type='generic', delaunay=True)
```

### Subsetting for Performance

For datasets with >10K spots, consider analyzing regions of interest:

```python
# Subset to a spatial region
mask = (adata.obsm['spatial'][:, 0] > x_min) & (adata.obsm['spatial'][:, 0] < x_max)
adata_subset = adata[mask].copy()
```

## Downstream Analysis Suggestions

1. **Cell type deconvolution:** Use SVG results + scRNA-seq reference to
   estimate cell type proportions per spot (cell2location, RCTD, STdeconvolve)
2. **Receptor-ligand analysis:** Identify spatially co-localized ligand-receptor
   pairs using CellChat or COMMOT
3. **Spatial gene-gene correlation:** Compute spatially-weighted correlation
   between SVGs to identify co-regulated programs
4. **Multi-sample comparison:** Integrate multiple Visium sections (e.g., MI vs
   control) using batch correction + differential spatial analysis
