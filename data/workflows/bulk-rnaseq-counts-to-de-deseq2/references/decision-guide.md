# DESeq2 Decision Guide

Decision trees for choosing between DESeq2 methods and approaches.

---

## Decision 1: Transformation Method

**When:** After DESeq(), before PCA/heatmaps **Question:** vst() or rlog()?

### Option A: VST (Variance Stabilizing Transformation)

**Use when:** n > 30 samples, need fast computation

**Pros:** Fast (1000+ samples OK), suitable for large datasets **Cons:** Less
accurate for small samples (n < 10)

```r
vsd <- vst(dds, blind = FALSE)  # blind=FALSE uses design (recommended)
```

### Option B: rlog (Regularized Log)

**Use when:** n < 30 samples, want best stabilization

**Pros:** Better for small samples, better at low counts **Cons:** Slow for
large datasets (>100 samples)

```r
rld <- rlog(dds, blind = FALSE)
```

### Decision Tree

```
n > 30 samples?
├─ YES → vst() (fast, appropriate for large datasets)
└─ NO → n < 10?
        ├─ YES → rlog() (better stabilization for small samples)
        └─ NO (10-30) → Either works (vst for speed, rlog for accuracy)
```

**When to use blind = TRUE:** Exploratory analysis without design, initial QC,
want natural clustering

## Decision 2: LFC Shrinkage Method

**When:** After results(), before ranking/plotting **Question:** Which shrinkage
method?

### Option A: apeglm (Recommended)

**Use when:** Ranking genes, publication plots, want best performance

**Pros:** Best shrinkage, preserves large LFC, accurate posteriors **Cons:**
Requires `coef` (not `contrast`), needs package, slightly slower

```r
library(apeglm)
resLFC <- lfcShrink(dds, coef = resultsNames(dds)[2], type = 'apeglm')
```

**Note:** Cannot use contrast specification

```r
# Works:
res <- lfcShrink(dds, coef = 'condition_treated_vs_control', type = 'apeglm')

# Doesn't work:
# res <- lfcShrink(dds, contrast = c('condition', 'treated', 'control'), type = 'apeglm')
```

### Option B: ashr

**Use when:** Large datasets (apeglm slow), need contrast specification

**Pros:** Good performance, fast, works with contrasts **Cons:** May over-shrink
large FC, inferior to apeglm for ranking

```r
resLFC <- lfcShrink(dds, coef = 'condition_treated_vs_control', type = 'ashr')
# Also works with contrasts
resLFC <- lfcShrink(dds, contrast = c('condition', 'treated', 'control'), type = 'ashr')
```

### Option C: normal (Legacy)

**Use when:** Backward compatibility, no apeglm/ashr

**Pros:** Fast, simple, no extra packages **Cons:** Inferior shrinkage, not
recommended for new analyses

```r
resLFC <- lfcShrink(dds, coef = 'condition_treated_vs_control', type = 'normal')
```

### Shrinkage vs Unshrunk

**Use SHRUNK for:**

- ✓ Ranking genes by effect size
- ✓ Visualization (volcano, MA plots, heatmaps)
- ✓ GSEA
- ✓ Selecting top genes for validation

**Use UNSHRUNK for:**

- ✓ Hypothesis testing (p-values)
- ✓ Reporting fold changes with CI
- ✓ Testing specific FC thresholds

```r
res <- results(dds)  # Unshrunk: hypothesis testing
resLFC <- lfcShrink(dds, coef = 'condition_treated_vs_control', type = 'apeglm')  # Shrunk: ranking/viz
```

## Decision 3: Design Formula

**When:** Before creating DESeqDataSet **Question:** Include covariates in
design?

### Option A: Simple (`~ condition`)

**Use when:** No batch effects, single factor, exploratory

**Pros:** Straightforward, easy to explain, maximum power for simple comparisons
**Cons:** Lower power if batch effects present, can't control confounders

```r
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(counts, coldata, design = ~ condition)
```

**Check first:**

```r
vsd <- vst(dds, blind = TRUE)
plotPCA(vsd, intgroup = "condition")
# Samples cluster by condition? → Use simple design
# Samples cluster by batch? → Use multi-factor design
```

### Option B: Multi-Factor (`~ batch + condition`)

**Use when:** Known batch effects, sequencing runs, PCA shows batch clustering

**Pros:** Controls confounders, higher power with batch, more accurate FC
**Cons:** Requires balanced design, uses degrees of freedom, complex
interpretation

```r
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(counts, coldata, design = ~ batch + condition)
res <- results(dds, name = 'condition_treated_vs_control')
```

**Critical:** Design must not be confounded

```r
# ✅ Works (balanced):
# batch 1: control, control, treated, treated
# batch 2: control, control, treated, treated

# ❌ Fails (confounded):
# batch 1: control, control
# batch 2: treated, treated
```

### Option C: Paired (`~ individual + condition`)

**Use when:** Same individuals before/after, matched pairs (tumor/normal)

**Pros:** Controls individual effects, higher power, reduces noise **Cons:**
Requires paired structure, can't test between-individual effects

```r
coldata <- data.frame(
  individual = factor(rep(1:5, each = 2)),
  condition = factor(rep(c('before', 'after'), 5))
)
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(counts, coldata, design = ~ individual + condition)
```

### Option D: Interaction (`~ genotype * treatment`)

**Use when:** Test if treatment effect differs by genotype, gene × environment

**Pros:** Tests interactions, identifies genotype-specific responses **Cons:**
Requires more samples (n ≥ 4 per group), complex interpretation

```r
design = ~ genotype + treatment + genotype:treatment
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Main effects
res_genotype <- results(dds, name = 'genotype_KO_vs_WT')
res_treatment <- results(dds, name = 'treatment_drug_vs_vehicle')

# Interaction: Does treatment effect differ by genotype?
res_interaction <- results(dds, name = 'genotypeKO.treatmentdrug')
```

### Decision Tree

```
Known batch effects or technical covariates?
├─ YES → Balanced design (batches in both conditions)?
│        ├─ YES → ~ batch + condition
│        └─ NO → Cannot adjust (confounded); consider batch correction
│
└─ NO → Paired samples (before/after, tumor/normal)?
        ├─ YES → ~ individual + condition
        └─ NO → Testing interactions?
                ├─ YES → ~ genotype * treatment
                └─ NO → ~ condition
```

### Checking Design

```r
# Check if full rank (not confounded)
design_matrix <- model.matrix(~ batch + condition, coldata)
Matrix::rankMatrix(design_matrix) == ncol(design_matrix)  # Should be TRUE

# Check PCA to see if batch correction helps
vsd <- vst(dds, blind = TRUE)
plotPCA(vsd, intgroup = c("condition", "batch"))
```

## Decision 4: Pre-Filtering Strategy

**When:** After creating DESeqDataSet, before DESeq()

### Option A: Minimum Total Counts (Standard)

```r
keep <- rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10
dds <- dds[keep,]
```

**Use:** Standard approach for most datasets

### Option B: Minimum Samples with Counts

```r
keep <- rowSums(counts(dds) >= 10) >= 3  # ≥3 samples with 10+ counts
dds <- dds[keep,]
```

**Use:** Small sample size, want genes expressed in multiple samples

### Option C: Mean Expression

```r
keep <- rowMeans(counts(dds)) >= 10
dds <- dds[keep,]
```

**Use:** Large sample size, filter by average expression

**Recommendation:** Use Option A for most analyses - simple and effective

## Decision 5: Significance Thresholds

**When:** Filtering results

### Standard Thresholds

| Threshold   | Use Case                  | Stringency |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| padj < 0.1  | DESeq2 default, discovery | Relaxed    |
| padj < 0.05 | Standard, most studies    | Moderate   |
| padj < 0.01 | High confidence           | Stringent  |

### Fold Change Thresholds

| Threshold        | FC   | Use Case     |
| ---------------- | ---- | ------------ |
| \|log2FC\| > 0.5 | 1.4× | Small effect |
| \|log2FC\| > 1   | 2×   | Standard     |
| \|log2FC\| > 2   | 4×   | Large effect |

### Examples

```r
# Standard
sig <- subset(res, padj < 0.05 & abs(log2FoldChange) > 1)

# Discovery
sig <- subset(res, padj < 0.1)

# High confidence
sig <- subset(res, padj < 0.01 & abs(log2FoldChange) > 2)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always check PCA first** before finalizing design formula
2. **Use shrinkage for visualization**, unshrunk for testing
3. **Document decisions** in analysis code
4. **Report both** unshrunk and shrunk results
5. **Validate top hits** with independent method
