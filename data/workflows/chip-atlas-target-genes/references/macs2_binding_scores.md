# MACS2 Binding Scores

## Score Formula

Binding scores in ChIP-Atlas Target Genes data are computed as:

```
Score = −10 × log10(MACS2 Q-value)
```

This transforms MACS2 Q-values (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values) into
positive scores where higher values indicate stronger binding evidence.

## Score Interpretation

| Score | MACS2 Q-value | Interpretation                                |
| ----- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | No peak       | No binding detected in this experiment        |
| 50    | 1e-5          | Default MACS2 threshold (weak but detectable) |
| 100   | 1e-10         | Moderate binding evidence                     |
| 200   | 1e-20         | Strong binding evidence                       |
| 500   | 1e-50         | Very strong binding evidence                  |
| 1000  | 1e-100        | Extremely strong binding evidence             |

## Color Mapping (ChIP-Atlas Web Interface)

The web interface uses a three-color gradient:

- **0** → Blue (no binding)
- **500** → Green (strong binding)
- **1000** → Red (very strong binding)

## Multiple Peaks

When multiple peaks from a single experiment overlap one gene's TSS window, only
the **highest** score is retained. This ensures each experiment contributes a
single score per gene.

## Average Score

The `{Protein}|Average` column contains the **arithmetic mean** of MACS2 scores
across all experiments for that antigen. This provides a consensus binding
strength:

- **High average (>500):** Consistently strong binding across many experiments —
  high-confidence direct target
- **Moderate average (100-500):** Binding detected in multiple experiments —
  likely target
- **Low average (10-100):** Binding in few experiments or weak peaks — possible
  target, may be cell-type-specific
- **Very low average (<10):** Marginal evidence — binding in very few
  experiments

### Averaging Includes Zeros

**Important:** The average is computed across ALL experiments, including those
with no binding (score 0). This means genes bound in fewer experiments get
diluted averages even if they have very strong binding in a few cell types. For
example, a gene with score 1000 in 5 experiments but 0 in 395 experiments would
have an average of ~12.5.

### Q-value Interpretation of Averaged Scores

**Important:** The score-to-Q-value mapping in the table above (e.g., 500 → Q =
1e-50) applies to **individual experiment** scores. The averaged scores reported
in gene rankings do NOT have a direct per-experiment Q-value interpretation
because the average includes zeros from experiments with no binding. An average
score of 500 means the _consensus across all experiments_ reaches that level —
it does NOT mean every experiment shows Q ≤ 1e-50. Use `max_score` to see the
strongest individual experiment evidence, and `binding_rate` to see how
consistently the gene is bound.

**Complementary metrics to consider:**

- **`max_score`** — Highest score in any single experiment. Captures strong
  cell-type-specific binding that the average may obscure.
- **`binding_rate`** — Fraction of experiments with any binding. High binding
  rate + moderate average suggests consistent but moderate binding; low binding
  rate + moderate average suggests strong but cell-type-specific binding.
- **Median non-zero score** — Not pre-computed, but can be derived from the
  per-experiment data to avoid zero dilution.

## Peak Calling Parameters

ChIP-Atlas uses `MACS2 callpeak` with:

- Q-value threshold: 1e-5 (default)
- Genome size: `-g hs` (human), `-g mm` (mouse), etc.
- Only peaks passing this threshold appear in target gene data
