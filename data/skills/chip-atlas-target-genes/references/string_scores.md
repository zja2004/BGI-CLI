# STRING Interaction Scores

## Overview

The `STRING` column in ChIP-Atlas Target Genes data contains protein-gene
interaction scores from the [STRING database](https://string-db.org/). These
scores provide orthogonal evidence that a TF regulates a target gene,
complementing the ChIP-seq binding evidence.

## Score Extraction

STRING scores are included when all of these conditions are met:

- `item_id_a` matches the query antigen (the TF/protein)
- `item_id_b` matches the target gene
- Interaction mode = `"expression"` (regulatory relationship)
- `a_is_acting` = `1` (the antigen is the regulator)

## Score Interpretation

| Score    | Interpretation                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0        | No STRING interaction evidence |
| 1-399    | Low confidence interaction     |
| 400-699  | Medium confidence interaction  |
| 700-899  | High confidence interaction    |
| 900-1000 | Highest confidence interaction |

## Combining with Binding Scores

The most confident target gene predictions have both:

1. **High average binding score** — Direct ChIP-seq evidence of TF binding near
   gene TSS
2. **High STRING score** — Independent evidence of regulatory relationship

| Binding Score | STRING Score | Confidence                                             |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| High (>200)   | High (>400)  | Very high — binding + regulatory evidence              |
| High (>200)   | 0            | High — binding evidence only (novel target?)           |
| Low (<50)     | High (>400)  | Moderate — known interaction but weak/indirect binding |
| Low (<50)     | 0            | Low — minimal evidence                                 |

## Limitations

- STRING covers well-studied interactions; novel or tissue-specific regulatory
  relationships may not be represented
- STRING "expression" mode captures co-expression and regulatory evidence, not
  exclusively direct regulation
- **Score of 0 does NOT mean "not a target"** — it means STRING lacks evidence
  for this specific pair. Even well-characterized, canonical targets can have
  STRING score 0. For example, BBC3 (PUMA) is one of the best-characterized TP53
  apoptosis targets, yet it has STRING score 0 in ChIP-Atlas data. This reflects
  gaps in STRING's coverage, not biological reality.
- When reporting results, always note that absence of STRING evidence is not
  evidence of absence. Genes with high binding scores but STRING score 0 may
  still be bona fide targets — they simply lack this particular line of
  orthogonal evidence.
