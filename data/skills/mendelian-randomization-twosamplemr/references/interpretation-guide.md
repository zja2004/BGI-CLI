# MR Results Interpretation Guide

## Quick Decision Tree

```
1. Is the IVW estimate significant (p < 0.05)?
   ├── YES → Go to step 2
   └── NO  → No evidence for causal effect (check power)

2. Do all methods agree on direction?
   ├── YES → Go to step 3
   └── NO  → Caution: methods disagree, investigate pleiotropy

3. Is there significant heterogeneity (Q p < 0.05)?
   ├── YES → Some instruments may be invalid; rely more on robust methods
   └── NO  → Go to step 4

4. Is there directional pleiotropy (Egger intercept p < 0.05)?
   ├── YES → IVW may be biased; prefer MR-Egger or weighted median estimate
   └── NO  → Go to step 5

5. Is the Steiger direction correct?
   ├── YES → Evidence supports proposed causal direction
   └── NO  → Reverse causation concern; test bidirectional MR

6. Is leave-one-out stable?
   ├── YES → Strong evidence for causality
   └── NO  → Investigate influential SNPs; result may be driven by one locus

## Reading the Results Table

The `mr_results.csv` contains one row per method:

| Column | Description                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| method | MR method name                 |
| nsnp   | Number of instruments used     |
| b      | Causal effect estimate (beta)  |
| se     | Standard error of the estimate |
| pval   | P-value for the causal effect  |

**Interpreting the beta:**

- **Continuous exposure → continuous outcome**: 1-unit increase in
  genetically-predicted exposure → b units change in outcome
- **Continuous exposure → binary outcome (log-OR)**: 1-unit increase in exposure
  → exp(b) odds ratio for outcome
- **Binary exposure (log-OR) → continuous outcome**: 1 log-OR increase in
  liability → b units change in outcome

## Reading the Plots

### Scatter Plot

- **What to look for**: Points should cluster around the IVW line
- **Good sign**: All method lines have similar slopes
- **Bad sign**: MR-Egger line has very different slope from IVW (suggests
  pleiotropy)
- **Bad sign**: Points scattered widely (heterogeneity)

### Forest Plot

- **What to look for**: Individual SNP estimates should overlap with the
  combined estimate
- **Good sign**: Most CIs cross the combined estimate line
- **Bad sign**: One or two SNPs far from the rest (potential
  outliers/pleiotropic instruments)

### Funnel Plot

- **What to look for**: Symmetric distribution around the IVW estimate
- **Good sign**: Symmetric funnel shape, most precise estimates near center
- **Bad sign**: Asymmetry suggests directional pleiotropy or bias

### Leave-One-Out Plot

- **What to look for**: Estimates should be stable regardless of which SNP is
  removed
- **Good sign**: All points within a narrow range, CIs overlap
- **Bad sign**: Removing one SNP dramatically shifts the estimate (that SNP is
  influential)

## Instrument Strength (F-statistics)

Each instrument's strength is measured by its F-statistic: F = (beta_exposure /
se_exposure)^2.

- **F > 10 per instrument**: Rule of thumb for sufficient instrument strength
- **Mean F > 10**: Overall instruments are adequately strong
- **F < 10**: Weak instrument — biases MR estimate toward the confounded
  observational estimate (toward null for two-sample MR)
- **Report**: Always report mean F-statistic, minimum F, and number of weak
  instruments

## MR-PRESSO (Outlier Detection)

MR-PRESSO (Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier) formally
tests for and removes outlier instruments.

- **When to run**: When Cochran's Q test shows significant heterogeneity (p <
  0.05)
- **Global test p < 0.05**: Significant outliers exist among instruments
- **Outlier test**: Identifies which specific SNPs are outliers
- **Distortion test**: Tests whether removing outliers significantly changes the
  IVW estimate
- **Outlier-corrected estimate**: IVW re-estimated after removing identified
  outliers
- **Important**: MR-PRESSO only detects outliers; biological investigation of
  flagged SNPs is still required

## Method Disagreement

When MR methods disagree, this warrants explicit discussion — not dismissal.

**Weighted Mode non-significant but others significant:**

- Weighted Mode has lower power than IVW or Weighted Median
- Non-significance may reflect low power rather than absence of effect
- However, if Weighted Mode points in the **opposite direction**, this is a
  stronger concern
- Always report and discuss — do not omit non-significant methods from the
  summary

**Discordant directions across methods:**

- If any method shows effect in the opposite direction to IVW, this is a red
  flag for pleiotropy
- Investigate the specific instruments driving the disagreement
- Consider MR-PRESSO to identify and remove pleiotropic outliers

## Binary Outcomes and Steiger Test

For binary (case-control) outcomes:

- **Default R² calculation assumes quantitative traits** — this is incorrect for
  binary outcomes
- **Correct approach**: Use `get_r_from_lor()` to convert log-odds ratios to R²
  on the liability scale
- **Requires**: Effect allele frequency, number of cases/controls, and
  population prevalence
- **If case/control info unavailable**: Flag that Steiger R² for the outcome may
  be inaccurate
- **Impact**: Incorrect R² can lead to wrong conclusions about causal direction

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Clean causal effect

- IVW significant, all methods agree, no heterogeneity, no pleiotropy, correct
  direction
- **Conclusion**: Strong evidence for causal effect

### Scenario 2: Heterogeneity but consistent direction

- IVW significant, methods agree on direction, Q p < 0.05, Egger intercept p >
  0.05
- **Conclusion**: Likely causal but some instruments may act through other
  pathways; weighted median provides a more robust estimate

### Scenario 3: Directional pleiotropy detected

- IVW significant, Egger intercept p < 0.05, Egger slope differs from IVW
- **Conclusion**: IVW may be biased; if MR-Egger slope is significant, causality
  may still hold but effect size is uncertain. Consider MR-PRESSO for outlier
  removal.

### Scenario 4: Methods disagree on direction

- IVW positive, MR-Egger negative (or vice versa)
- **Conclusion**: Weak evidence; substantial pleiotropy likely. Do not claim
  causality.

### Scenario 5: Result driven by one SNP

- Leave-one-out shows one SNP dramatically changes the estimate
- **Conclusion**: Investigate that SNP's biology. If it's in a pleiotropic
  region, consider removing it and re-running.

### Scenario 6: Extreme heterogeneity with discordant outlier SNPs

- Cochran's Q p < 1e-10, single-SNP analysis reveals SNPs with
  opposite-direction effects
- MR-PRESSO identifies specific outlier instruments
- **Conclusion**: Run outlier-corrected analysis. Compare original vs corrected
  estimates. Investigate biology of outlier SNPs (e.g., pleiotropic loci like
  APOE). Report both estimates.

### Scenario 7: Weighted Mode disagrees with other methods

- IVW, MR-Egger, Weighted Median significant and concordant; Weighted Mode
  non-significant
- **Conclusion**: May reflect lower statistical power of Weighted Mode. If
  direction is concordant, causality is still supported. If direction is
  discordant, investigate pleiotropy. Always report explicitly.

## Caveats

1. **MR estimates reflect lifelong exposure** — genetic variants are fixed at
   conception, so MR estimates reflect the effect of long-term differences in
   exposure, not acute interventions
2. **Population-specific** — instruments may have different effects across
   ancestries
3. **Linear assumption** — standard MR assumes a linear dose-response
   relationship
4. **Cannot distinguish closely related traits** — if BMI and waist
   circumference share instruments, MR cannot determine which is the true causal
   factor
5. **Winner's curse** — selecting instruments from the same GWAS as estimation
   can inflate associations
6. **Sample overlap** — if exposure and outcome GWAS share participants, can
   introduce bias (use two-sample design to minimize)
