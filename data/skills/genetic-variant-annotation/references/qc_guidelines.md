# Quality Control Guidelines for Variant Annotation

This document provides detailed QC checkpoints and expected metrics for each
stage of variant annotation.

---

## 1. VCF Validation (Step 1)

### Critical Checkpoints

✅ **Format validation**

- VCF passes format validation with no parsing errors
- Conforms to VCF 4.2 specification
- All required fields present (CHROM, POS, ID, REF, ALT, QUAL, FILTER, INFO)

✅ **Reference genome matching**

- All contigs in VCF header match reference genome
- Contig names consistent (e.g., "chr1" vs "1")
- Variant positions within contig boundaries
- No off-by-one coordinate errors

✅ **Variant integrity**

- No duplicate variant positions
- REF alleles match reference genome
- ALT alleles are valid nucleotide sequences
- Multiallelic sites properly formatted

✅ **Sample data quality**

- FILTER fields consistent across variants
- Genotype calls complete (minimal missing data)
- FORMAT fields properly defined in header
- Phase information valid if present

### Expected Metrics

| Metric            | Whole Genome | Whole Exome | Notes                         |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Ti/Tv ratio**   | 2.0 - 2.1    | 2.8 - 3.0   | Transition/transversion ratio |
| **Het/Hom ratio** | 1.5 - 2.0    | 1.5 - 2.0   | Heterozygous/homozygous ratio |
| **Average QUAL**  | > 30         | > 30        | Variant quality score         |
| **PASS rate**     | > 90%        | > 95%       | % variants passing filters    |
| **Indel rate**    | 10-15%       | 5-10%       | % indels vs SNVs              |

### Red Flags

❌ **Poor variant quality:**

- Ti/Tv < 1.5 (suggests low-quality variant calls)
- Very high indel rate (> 20% of variants)
- Mean QUAL < 20
- High proportion of multiallelic sites (> 10%)

❌ **Reference mismatch:**

- Many REF alleles don't match reference genome
- Variants outside contig boundaries
- Inconsistent chromosome naming

❌ **Data integrity issues:**

- Large number of missing genotypes (> 10%)
- Inconsistent ploidy
- FILTER fields not defined in header
- Sample names duplicated or missing

### Common VCF Issues and Fixes

| Issue                      | Cause                              | Solution                                   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| "Invalid VCF header"       | Malformed header lines             | Fix ##INFO, ##FORMAT, ##contig definitions |
| "Chromosome not found"     | Chr naming mismatch (chr1 vs 1)    | Use bcftools annotate to rename contigs    |
| "Duplicate positions"      | Same variant listed multiple times | Deduplicate with bcftools norm -d          |
| "REF doesn't match genome" | Wrong reference genome             | Re-call variants with correct reference    |
| "Missing genotype data"    | Incomplete variant calling         | Filter variants with high missingness      |

---

## 2. Annotation Completeness (Steps 3-4)

### Critical Checkpoints

✅ **Annotation success**

- 100% of variants successfully annotated
- No skipped variants in output
- VEP/SNPEff completed without errors
- Output VCF/file size reasonable (not empty)

✅ **Consequence assignment**

- Every variant has at least one consequence
- Consequence terms valid (from Sequence Ontology)
- IMPACT assigned (HIGH/MODERATE/LOW/MODIFIER)
- Transcript information present for coding variants

✅ **Gene annotation**

- Gene symbols present for coding/regulatory variants
- Ensembl Gene IDs assigned
- Transcript IDs correspond to correct genome build
- Canonical transcripts marked (if requested)

✅ **Supplementary annotations**

- Population frequencies present (if plugin enabled)
- Pathogenicity scores populated (for missense variants)
- Clinical annotations loaded (ClinVar, COSMIC)
- HGVS notation generated correctly

### Expected Metrics

| Metric              | Whole Genome | Whole Exome | Notes                       |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| **Annotation rate** | 100%         | 100%        | All variants annotated      |
| **Coding variants** | 1-2%         | 40-60%      | % coding consequences       |
| **Gene assignment** | 30-50%       | > 95%       | % variants with gene symbol |
| **HIGH impact**     | 0.01-0.05%   | 0.1-0.5%    | Stop-gain, frameshift, etc. |
| **MODERATE impact** | 0.5-1%       | 10-20%      | Missense, inframe indels    |
| **ClinVar matches** | 0.01-0.1%    | 0.1-1%      | Known clinical variants     |

### Red Flags

❌ **Annotation failure:**

- Large number of variants with no consequence assigned
- No gene symbols for exome variants (> 50% intergenic)
- All consequences are "intergenic_variant" in exome
- Empty or truncated output file

❌ **Genome build mismatch:**

- Most exome variants annotated as intergenic (should be coding)
- Very few gene hits in targeted sequencing
- ClinVar matches absent for common clinical panels
- Check: VCF genome build vs annotation database build

❌ **Plugin/database issues:**

- All pathogenicity scores missing (SIFT, PolyPhen)
- No population frequencies (gnomAD, 1000G)
- ClinVar annotations absent
- Check: Plugins installed and databases downloaded

### VEP-Specific Checks

**Cache vs API mode:**

- Cache mode: 100-1000x faster, requires 15-20 GB disk
- API mode: Very slow for large VCFs, no disk space needed
- Recommendation: Always use cache for > 1000 variants

**Plugin verification:**

```bash
# Check installed VEP plugins
vep --list_plugins

# Expected plugins for clinical analysis:
# - CADD
# - dbNSFP
# - REVEL
# - SpliceAI
# - Mastermind
```

**Common VEP errors:**

```bash
# "Cache directory not found"
# Solution: Download cache
vep_install -a cf -s homo_sapiens -y GRCh38

# "Plugin failed: CADD"
# Solution: Download CADD scores
cd $VEP_CACHE_DIR
wget https://krishna.gs.washington.edu/download/CADD/v1.6/GRCh38/whole_genome_SNVs.tsv.gz
```

### SNPEff-Specific Checks

**Database verification:**

```bash
# List available databases
snpEff databases | grep -i GRCh38

# Expected output for human:
# GRCh38.105 (Ensembl release 105)
# GRCh38.p13 (RefSeq annotation)
```

**Annotation field validation:**

- ANN field present in INFO column
- ANN subfields: Allele|Annotation|Impact|Gene_Name|...
- LOF field present (if loss-of-function plugin enabled)
- NMD field present (if nonsense-mediated decay enabled)

**Common SNPEff errors:**

```bash
# "Genome 'GRCh38' not found"
# Solution: Download SNPEff database
snpEff download -v GRCh38.105

# "Cannot read FASTA file"
# Solution: SNPEff doesn't need FASTA (only database)
# Remove -ref option if present
```

## 3. Filtering Results (Step 5)

### Critical Checkpoints

✅ **Appropriate stringency**

- Filtering criteria match use case
- Not over-filtering (losing true positives)
- Not under-filtering (too many variants)
- Balance sensitivity vs specificity

✅ **Consequence filtering**

- Impact thresholds appropriate
- Critical consequence types included
- Synonymous variants excluded (or included if needed)

✅ **Frequency filtering**

- Population frequency threshold appropriate for disease model
- Rare disease: AF < 0.01 (dominant) or < 0.05 (recessive)
- Common disease: More permissive thresholds
- Missing frequencies handled correctly

✅ **Quality filtering**

- Variant quality (QUAL) threshold applied
- Depth of coverage (DP) considered
- Allele balance checked for heterozygous variants
- PASS filter applied if appropriate

### Expected Metrics After Filtering

| Filter Level               | Whole Exome   | Whole Genome   | Clinical Sample |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| **All variants**           | 20,000-40,000 | 3-5 million    | Variable        |
| **Coding variants**        | 8,000-15,000  | 50,000-100,000 | 100-5,000       |
| **HIGH/MODERATE impact**   | 5,000-10,000  | 30,000-60,000  | 50-2,000        |
| **Rare (AF < 0.01)**       | 500-2,000     | 10,000-30,000  | 20-500          |
| **Rare + HIGH impact**     | 10-50         | 100-500        | 1-20            |
| **Prioritized pathogenic** | 1-20          | 10-100         | 0-10            |

### Decision Point: Adjust Filtering Thresholds

**Too many variants (> 1000 after filtering):**

- ✅ Decrease allele frequency threshold (0.01 → 0.001)
- ✅ Increase pathogenicity score threshold (CADD > 25, REVEL > 0.7)
- ✅ Require multiple pathogenicity predictions to agree
- ✅ Filter to HIGH impact only (exclude MODERATE)
- ✅ Include only ClinVar Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic

**Too few variants (< 5 after filtering):**

- ✅ Increase allele frequency threshold (0.01 → 0.05)
- ✅ Decrease pathogenicity score threshold (CADD > 15, REVEL > 0.3)
- ✅ Include MODERATE impact variants
- ✅ Include variants of uncertain significance (VUS)
- ✅ Check if variants were lost in earlier QC steps

**No candidate variants:**

- ⚠️ Review original VCF quality (Ti/Tv ratio, variant counts)
- ⚠️ Verify genome build matches (VCF vs annotation database)
- ⚠️ Check if disease gene is in targeted region (for panels)
- ⚠️ Consider expanding to VUS or lower impact variants
- ⚠️ Review inheritance model and filtering assumptions

### Use Case-Specific Filtering Strategies

**1. Clinical Diagnostics (Rare Mendelian Disease)**

```
Stringent filtering:
- Impact: HIGH or MODERATE only
- Frequency: gnomAD AF < 0.01 (dominant) or < 0.05 (recessive)
- Pathogenicity: CADD > 20 OR REVEL > 0.5 OR ClinVar P/LP
- Quality: QUAL > 30, DP > 10, AB 0.3-0.7 (het)
- Consequences: Loss-of-function, missense, splice site

Expected output: 1-20 candidate variants per patient
```

**2. Cancer Genomics (Somatic Variants)**

```
Cancer-specific filtering:
- Impact: HIGH, MODERATE, or known cancer hotspot
- Frequency: Not present in germline (gnomAD AF < 0.001)
- Databases: COSMIC mutations, OncoKB variants
- Quality: Tumor VAF > 0.05, normal VAF < 0.02
- Genes: Cancer gene census, driver genes

Expected output: 1-10 driver mutations per tumor
```

**3. Population Genetics (Research)**

```
Permissive filtering:
- Impact: All impact levels
- Frequency: AF < 0.05 or no frequency filter
- Quality: QUAL > 20, DP > 5
- Consequences: All coding variants

Expected output: 500-5,000 variants per sample
```

**4. Pharmacogenomics**

```
PGx-specific filtering:
- Genes: PGx gene list (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, TPMT, etc.)
- Impact: All impacts (including synonymous if functional)
- Frequency: No frequency filter (common variants important)
- Databases: PharmGKB clinical annotations
- Include: Star alleles, structural variants

Expected output: 10-100 PGx variants per sample
```

## 4. Gene-Level Summary (Step 6)

### Critical Checkpoints

✅ **Gene aggregation**

- Variants correctly grouped by gene
- Multiple transcripts handled appropriately
- Gene symbols standardized (HGNC for human)
- Ensembl IDs match genome build

✅ **Variant counting**

- Total variants per gene accurate
- Counts by impact level (HIGH/MODERATE/LOW)
- Counts by consequence type
- No double-counting of variants

✅ **Score aggregation**

- Maximum or mean scores calculated correctly
- Missing scores handled appropriately
- Scores correspond to correct variants

### Expected Metrics

| Metric                     | Clinical Panel | Whole Exome  | Whole Genome  |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| **Genes with variants**    | 50-200         | 8,000-12,000 | 15,000-20,000 |
| **Genes with HIGH impact** | 5-20           | 50-200       | 100-500       |
| **Genes with 2+ variants** | 10-50          | 1,000-3,000  | 3,000-8,000   |
| **Mean variants per gene** | 1-3            | 1-2          | 2-5           |

### Red Flags

❌ One gene has > 100 variants: Possible alignment artifact or repeat region ❌
No genes with > 1 variant: Over-filtering or small sample size ❌ Many genes
with only synonymous variants: Consider filtering these out

---

## 5. Variant Prioritization (Step 7)

### Critical Checkpoints

✅ **Prioritization criteria**

- Scoring system appropriate for use case
- Weights reflect clinical/research priorities
- ACMG criteria applied correctly (for clinical)
- ClinVar annotations weighted highly

✅ **Pathogenicity classification**

- ACMG/AMP categories assigned
- Evidence criteria documented
- Conflicting predictions handled
- Uncertain significance not over-interpreted

### Expected Metrics

| Priority Level        | Expected Count  | Interpretation                           |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Pathogenic**        | 0-5 per sample  | Known pathogenic, report immediately     |
| **Likely Pathogenic** | 1-10 per sample | Strong evidence, clinical follow-up      |
| **VUS**               | 5-50 per sample | Uncertain, monitor or functional studies |
| **Likely Benign**     | Many            | Can filter out for clinical reports      |
| **Benign**            | Many            | Can filter out for clinical reports      |

### Decision Point: Clinical Reporting

**Report immediately:**

- ✅ ClinVar Pathogenic in disease-relevant gene
- ✅ Known disease-causing variant (HGMD, ClinVar)
- ✅ Loss-of-function in haploinsufficient gene
- ✅ ACMG secondary findings (incidental findings)

**Report with caution:**

- ⚠️ VUS in disease-relevant gene with strong predictions
- ⚠️ Novel missense with CADD > 30, REVEL > 0.9
- ⚠️ Splicing variant near canonical splice site
- ⚠️ De novo variant in patient-parent trio

**Do not report:**

- ❌ Common variants (AF > 0.05) unless pharmacogenomic
- ❌ Synonymous variants (unless functional evidence)
- ❌ Benign or Likely benign ClinVar classification
- ❌ Variants in genes unrelated to phenotype

---

## 6. Visualization QC (Step 8)

### Expected Visualizations

**1. Consequence Distribution**

- Most variants should be intronic or intergenic (genome)
- Most variants should be coding (exome)
- Missense variants most common coding consequence
- Stop-gain and frameshift rare (< 1%)

**2. Impact by Chromosome**

- Impact distribution similar across chromosomes
- No chromosome with disproportionate HIGH impact (may indicate QC issue)
- Sex chromosomes (X, Y) may differ in coverage/calling

**3. Pathogenicity Score Distributions**

- CADD scores: Most variants < 20, few > 30
- REVEL scores: Bimodal distribution (benign vs deleterious)
- PolyPhen: Categories clearly separated

**4. Allele Frequency**

- Most variants rare (AF < 0.01)
- Log-scale distribution shows full spectrum
- Very rare variants (AF < 0.0001) most enriched

**5. Gene Burden**

- Some genes naturally have more variants (large genes)
- Outliers may indicate artifacts or true hotspots
- Compare to known mutation-tolerant/intolerant genes

### Red Flags in Visualizations

❌ **Uniform consequences:** If all variants same consequence, annotation may
have failed ❌ **Single chromosome outlier:** Possible batch effect or alignment
issue ❌ **No rare variants:** Frequency filtering may be too stringent ❌ **All
high-scoring:** Pathogenicity filtering may be too permissive
