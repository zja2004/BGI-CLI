## Hybrid Approach

For some projects, using **both tools** may be optimal:

### Strategy 1: SNPEff First, VEP for Follow-Up

1. **Initial QC with SNPEff:**
   - Fast annotation for all variants
   - Assess variant distribution and quality
   - Filter to HIGH/MODERATE impact variants

2. **Detailed annotation with VEP:**
   - Re-annotate filtered variants with VEP
   - Add comprehensive pathogenicity predictions
   - Include clinical database annotations

**Advantage:** Fast initial QC, detailed annotation only where needed

### Strategy 2: VEP for Clinical, SNPEff for Research

1. **Clinical samples → VEP:**
   - Patient diagnostic samples
   - Clinical reporting required
   - Comprehensive annotations needed

2. **Research samples → SNPEff:**
   - Population studies
   - Exploratory analyses
   - Quick turnaround needed

**Advantage:** Optimize resource use per sample type

### Strategy 3: Cross-Validation

1. **Annotate with both tools:**
   - Run VEP and SNPEff in parallel
   - Compare consequence assignments
   - Identify discrepancies

2. **Use consensus annotations:**
   - Retain variants annotated similarly by both
   - Manually review discordant annotations
   - Increase confidence in results

**Advantage:** Higher confidence, catches annotation errors
