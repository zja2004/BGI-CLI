# Decision Guide for Functional Enrichment Analysis

Comprehensive guidance for making key decisions during functional enrichment
analysis.

---

## Decision 1: GSEA vs ORA vs Both

**When:** Before starting analysis

**Question:** Which enrichment method should I use?

### Option 1: GSEA Only (Recommended)

**Use when:**

- You have complete DE results with fold changes and p-values
- Want comprehensive analysis without arbitrary cutoffs
- Need to detect subtle coordinated pathway changes
- Publishing in high-impact journals (GSEA preferred in literature)

**Advantages:**

- Uses ALL genes ranked by expression change
- Detects coordinated changes across pathways
- More statistically powerful than ORA
- No arbitrary significance cutoffs required
- Better handles genes with modest but coordinated changes
- Recommended by methodological benchmarking studies

**Disadvantages:**

- Computationally slower (requires permutations)
- Results can be harder to interpret for non-experts
- Requires ranked gene list (not just gene names)

**When to use:**

- Default choice for most analyses
- Exploratory pathway analysis
- When you have full DE results with statistics
- When you want most sensitive detection

### Option 2: ORA Only

**Use when:**

- You have only a gene list without fold changes
- Need quick preliminary analysis
- Want simple, intuitive results for presentations
- Working with predefined gene sets from literature

**Advantages:**

- Simple, intuitive interpretation
- Faster computation (no permutations)
- Easy to explain to non-computational collaborators
- Works with gene lists from any source

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires arbitrary cutoffs (padj < 0.05, |log2FC| > 1)
- Less sensitive than GSEA
- Can miss pathways with coordinated subtle changes
- Treats all significant genes equally (ignores magnitude)
- Background gene set choice affects results

**When to use:**

- You only have gene names without fold changes
- Quick validation of GSEA results
- Presenting to non-computational audience
- Working with gene lists from literature or databases

### Option 3: Both GSEA and ORA

**Use when:**

- Want thorough analysis with validation
- Preparing results for publication
- Need to compare methods
- Want both sensitive detection (GSEA) and intuitive validation (ORA)

**Advantages:**

- ORA validates GSEA findings
- Provides complementary perspectives
- Increases confidence in shared results
- Useful for methods sections in papers

**Disadvantages:**

- More computation time
- More results to interpret
- May show discrepancies requiring explanation

**When to use:**

- High-stakes projects (grants, publications)
- When you want maximum confidence
- When reviewers may ask for validation
- Exploratory analysis where you're unsure what to expect

### Recommendation Matrix

| Scenario                         | Method   | Rationale                             |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Full DE results available        | **GSEA** | Most sensitive, uses all information  |
| Only gene list (no fold changes) | **ORA**  | Only option without rankings          |
| High-impact publication          | **Both** | Cross-validation increases confidence |
| Quick exploratory analysis       | **GSEA** | Best balance of speed and sensitivity |
| Presenting to clinicians         | **ORA**  | Simpler interpretation                |
| Grant proposal/preliminary data  | **Both** | Shows thoroughness                    |

## Decision 3: Ranking Metric for GSEA

**When:** Preparing ranked gene list (Step 2)

**Question:** How should I rank genes for GSEA?

### Option 1: Test Statistic (Best)

**Use when:** Available in your DE results

**Formula:**

- DESeq2: `stat` column (Wald statistic)
- limma: `t` statistic
- edgeR: Custom calculation or use `logFC/sqrt(dispersion)`

**Advantages:**

- Accounts for both effect size AND significance
- Best balance of signal and noise
- Recommended by GSEA developers
- Handles low-expressed genes appropriately

**Disadvantages:**

- Not always available (depends on DE method)
- Different meaning across methods

**Recommendation:** Always use if available (default for DESeq2, limma)

### Option 2: Signed -log10(p-value)

**Use when:** Test statistic unavailable

**Formula:** `sign(log2FC) × -log10(pvalue)`

**Advantages:**

- Emphasizes statistical significance
- Easy to compute from any DE results
- Intuitive interpretation

**Disadvantages:**

- Can overweight genes with very low p-values
- May rank lowly-expressed, noisy genes too highly
- Doesn't account for fold change magnitude well

**Recommendation:** Good fallback when test statistic unavailable

### Option 3: Signed -log10(adjusted p-value)

**Use when:** Want to emphasize FDR-controlled results

**Formula:** `sign(log2FC) × -log10(padj)`

**Advantages:**

- Incorporates multiple testing correction
- Conservative ranking

**Disadvantages:**

- Can compress rankings (many genes at padj boundaries)
- Less dynamic range than pvalue-based ranking
- May miss coordinated subtle changes

**Recommendation:** Use with caution, usually pvalue is better for ranking

### Option 4: log2 Fold Change Only

**Use when:** No p-values available (rare)

**Formula:** `log2FC`

**Advantages:**

- Simple
- Only needs fold changes

**Disadvantages:**

- ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED
- Ignores statistical significance
- Ranks noisy, low-count genes highly
- Poor performance in benchmarks

**Recommendation:** Avoid unless absolutely no alternative

### Ranking Comparison

| Metric                  | Best For     | Sensitivity | Specificity | Ease                |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| **Test statistic**      | Most cases   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  | Easy (if available) |
| **Signed -log10(p)**    | Fallback     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    | Easy                |
| **Signed -log10(padj)** | Conservative | ⭐⭐⭐      | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  | Easy                |
| **log2FC only**         | Desperate    | ⭐⭐        | ⭐⭐        | Easy                |

### Decision Tree

```
Do you have test statistics (stat, t)?
├─ YES → Use test statistic ✓
└─ NO → Do you have p-values?
    ├─ YES → Use sign(log2FC) × -log10(pvalue) ✓
    └─ NO → Can you get p-values?
        ├─ YES → Re-run DE analysis to get p-values
        └─ NO → Use log2FC only (suboptimal)
```

## Decision 4: ORA Significance Thresholds

**When:** Filtering genes for ORA (Step 2 if running ORA)

**Question:** What thresholds should I use to define significant genes?

### Standard Thresholds (Recommended)

**Default:** padj ≤ 0.05, |log2FC| ≥ 1

**Rationale:**

- padj < 0.05: Standard FDR control (5% false discoveries)
- |log2FC| ≥ 1: 2-fold change (biological relevance)
- Widely used in literature
- Good balance of sensitivity and specificity

### Alternative Thresholds

#### More Stringent (Conservative)

**Use:** padj ≤ 0.01, |log2FC| ≥ 1.5

**When:**

- High-noise data
- Want highest confidence results
- Many significant genes (>1,000)

#### More Permissive (Exploratory)

**Use:** padj ≤ 0.1, |log2FC| ≥ 0.5

**When:**

- Few significant genes (<50)
- Exploratory analysis
- Subtle biological effects expected

### Threshold Guidelines

| Scenario                  | padj  | log2FC | Rationale                |
| ------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| **Standard**              | ≤0.05 | ≥1     | Default, balanced        |
| **Few DE genes (<50)**    | ≤0.1  | ≥0.5   | More permissive          |
| **Many DE genes (>1000)** | ≤0.01 | ≥1.5   | More stringent           |
| **High-noise data**       | ≤0.01 | ≥1     | Focus on high confidence |
| **Biological validation** | ≤0.05 | ≥2     | High fold change         |

**Recommendation:** Start with defaults, adjust only if results are too sparse
or too abundant.

## Decision 5: Number of Permutations for GSEA

**When:** Running GSEA (Step 4)

**Question:** How many permutations should I use?

### Options

#### 1,000 permutations

**Use:** Quick testing, preliminary analysis

**Advantages:**

- Fast (~1-2 minutes)
- Good for prototyping

**Disadvantages:**

- Less stable p-values
- Not publication-quality

#### 10,000 permutations (Default)

**Use:** Final analysis, publication

**Advantages:**

- Stable p-values
- Publication-quality
- Good balance of accuracy and speed

**Disadvantages:**

- Takes 10-20 minutes
- More memory usage

#### 100,000 permutations

**Use:** Rarely needed

**Advantages:**

- Highest precision
- Best for borderline significant pathways

**Disadvantages:**

- Very slow (~2 hours)
- Diminishing returns

### Recommendation Matrix

| Use Case               | Permutations | Rationale            |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| **Testing code**       | 1,000        | Fast iteration       |
| **Final analysis**     | 10,000       | Default standard     |
| **Publication**        | 10,000       | Sufficient precision |
| **Borderline results** | 100,000      | Extra precision      |

**General recommendation:** Use 10,000 for all final analyses.
