# ChIP-Atlas Peak Calling Thresholds

ChIP-Atlas provides pre-called peaks at four stringency levels based on MACS2
significance scores.

## Threshold Scale

The API threshold parameter represents MACS2 `-10 * log10(p-value)`:

| Threshold | MACS2 Score          | P-value (approx) | Stringency  | Recommended For                                     |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **50**    | -10\*log10(p) >= 50  | 1e-5             | **Default** | Standard analysis, balanced sensitivity/specificity |
| **100**   | -10\*log10(p) >= 100 | 1e-10            | High        | High-confidence peaks only                          |
| **200**   | -10\*log10(p) >= 200 | 1e-20            | Very high   | Ultra-stringent, strongest binding only             |
| **500**   | -10\*log10(p) >= 500 | 1e-50            | Extreme     | Exceptionally strong binding events                 |

## Choosing a Threshold

### Threshold 50 (1e-5) - **RECOMMENDED DEFAULT**

- Standard enrichment analysis
- Discovering new regulatory relationships
- Works well for most transcription factors
- Typical: ~5,000-10,000 peaks per TF experiment

### Threshold 100 (1e-10) - High Stringency

- High-confidence binding sites only
- Minimizing false positives critical
- Typical: ~1,000-5,000 peaks per experiment

### Threshold 200 (1e-20) - Very High Stringency

- Ultra-high-confidence peaks required
- May miss weaker true positives
- Typical: ~100-1,000 peaks per experiment

### Threshold 500 (1e-50) - Extreme

- Strongest binding events only
- Very few peaks per experiment
- Useful for histone marks with broad domains

## Impact on Enrichment Analysis

Higher thresholds produce fewer peaks but higher fold enrichments. Lower
thresholds provide better sensitivity but include more noise. The API default of
50 provides good balance.

## Recommendations by Factor Type

| Factor Type               | Recommended Threshold | Rationale                                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Transcription Factors** | 50                    | Balance sensitivity/specificity            |
| **Histone Modifications** | 50 or 100             | Broader regions, can use higher stringency |
| **Chromatin Remodelers**  | 50                    | Often have weaker signals                  |
| **ATAC-seq**              | 50                    | Standard open chromatin                    |
